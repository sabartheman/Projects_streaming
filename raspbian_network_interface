### This whole file is structured to be copied directly into /etc/network/interfaces  Setting up the network is a lot easier if you have previous experience.
### In case something is messed up saving a copy of the old network file as backup would be a good idea.  This file was structured for rasbian (wheezy may-4th-2015)  
### currently there is a new version of Raspbian called Jesse the interface file might be a little different from it.  I will add more to this when I am able to look into it.


auto lo
iface lo inet loopback



auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet manual   ### <- comment this out if uncommenting the static section

###  If you take these following lines out of comment you must comment the line above that sets the eth0 to manual

#iface eth0 inet static

#address 192.168.1.3
#netmask 255.255.255.0
#gateway 192.168.1.20
