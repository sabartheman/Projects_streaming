### 

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

### i do testing over wifi as well as ethernet, the debian config file for the wifi doesn't like to have a static 
### ethernet (eth0), If I want to stream over ethernet I use a static set to 192.168.1.3  

auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet manual   ### <- comment this out if uncommenting the static section

###  If you take these following lines out of comment you must comment the line above that sets the eth0 to manual

#iface eth0 inet static

#address 192.168.1.3
#netmask 255.255.255.0
#gateway 192.168.1.20


### everything below here is for the debian wifi set up if a wifi dongle is plugged into the Pi
### if you want to manually change your wifi settings you can find them by following the path that is shown below

allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
