There are a few programs required for streaming to a computer.  


You need to install VLC on both the Raspberry pi and the computer you want to stream to.  
    To install on the Pi make sure that you have a working internet connection through either ethernet or wifi(usb wifi dongle not included)
      1.open up terminal
      2.type in sudo apt-get update
        this updates the registries to update your device
      3.if you didn't get a can't connect to server error type in: sudo apt-get install vlc
        it will prompt you if you want to use the space to install, enter: Y
        
        If you did get a error saying that no connection could be established then check your internet connection by pinging a known site.
        I usually just enter in: ping google.com   to check if I have connection.  
        If you are sending and recieving packets then make sure that the ethernet is actually plugged into a ISP modem port or if you are on wifi make sure that your security credentials are corrent.
      
      4. you just have installed VLC on you PI gratse.
      
    To install it on your computer go to: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/
    Then pick the install that matches your operating system, download, and install.
    


You will need some way to communicate with the raspberry pi package.  This can be accomplished in several ways.

    If you have set up a ssh server to run every time you start up the raspberry pi you could just ssh into the Pi.
    I usually do this so that I can manipulate the pi from my laptop/desktop. This will be mentioned serveral times but you can set this up on the pi by typing in: sudo raspi-config   and enabling the ssh-server.

OSX or Linux operating systems:
  you can use the terminal to connect with your pi
  
  you need the address and name of the user account you want to access on the pi. 
  Make sure that there is a ssh-server running on the pi, this can be set up through raspi-config
  
   1. open up terminal 
   2. enter in the username and address in this format:  username@address -> Ex:  pi@192.168.1.2
   3. when prompted enter in the password to the account.
  
  at this point you will be connected to the Pi through a ssh server connection.  
  
  
   
  

Windows operating systems:  
  Putty:  While it is easy to use I am partial on the gui that is given.  Currently you can download putty at: http://www.putty.org/
          After installing putty open it up and you will see the main window for putty.
          
          You don't have to modify any of putty's advanced options to ssh with the Pi.
          
          Find out the address of your Pi by either using: ifconfig in the terminal or setting the IP to a static address.
          Once you have the address put that into the Host Name line and make sure that the port is 22(common connection port for ssh)
          On the connection type pick SSH, you can save these settings by clicking save at this point by make sure you name it.
          Finally clicking open will start up a terminal-ish window that will sit there polling the IP and looking for a ssh server to connect to.
          If there is a connection you will be asked to log into the PI.
          
          If you have problems connecting to your Pi
            1. make sure that you have a ssh-server running (run sudo raspi-config and enable ssh server)
            2. check your IP address on you Pi to make sure that you have the right address.
            3. your firewall might be blocking the connection. check to make sure that it doesn't think it is a malicious task/program
            4. your network security settings might be too strict, in this case if you are at home just go change them to be less strict or if you are on a campus you will need to contact IT to move past here.
            
          
          At this point you can use the command that is given in the file: Video_streaming_pi_side
          
          raspivid -t 0 -h 1080 -w 1920d -fps 25 -vf -b 2000000 -n -o - | tee -a test_video.h264 | cvlc stream:///dev/stdin --sout '#rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8080/}' -vvv :demux=h264
          
          The explanation of what this line does is in the Video_streaming_pi_side file.
  
  Cygwin:  This gui is a little nicer to look at and it functions as a terminal on Windows systems.  Which can come in handy if you dont want to deal with Command Prompt (cmd)
           You can download this program at: https://cygwin.com/install.html
           
           To use Cygwin you need to know the username and address of your Pi.  By default the user name of a Raspian/Noobs user account is pi
           I would recommend changing this for security reasons.
           The address can be found through using: ifconfig or setting it up as a static address.
           
           Make sure that there is a ssh server running on the raspberry pi!!
           
           To connect 
            1.open up Cygwin
            2.enter in your pi's username and address in format like this:    pi@address  -> Ex. pi@192.168.1.2
            
           This will start the process of connecting to your pi, if it can connect you will be prompted for the password to your pi.
           if you connect you can enter in the command below, if not run through the troubleshooting connection list farther below
           
          raspivid -t 0 -h 1080 -w 1920d -fps 25 -vf -b 2000000 -n -o - | tee -a test_video.h264 | cvlc stream:///dev/stdin --sout '#rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8080/}' -vvv :demux=h264
          
          
          
          If you have problems connecting to your Pi
            1. make sure that you have a ssh-server running (run sudo raspi-config and enable ssh server)
            2. check your IP address on you Pi to make sure that you have the right address.
            3. your firewall might be blocking the connection. check to make sure that it doesn't think it is a malicious task/program
            4. your network security settings might be too strict, in this case if you are at home just go change them to be less strict or if you are on a campus you will need to contact IT to move past here.
            
          
          
          There are other programs that you can use to connect to the pi but they usually have a remote desktop-esk feel and they take up more processing power.
            ex: tightvnc, remina, vnc
