There are a few programs required for streaming to a computer.  


You will need some way to communicate with the raspberry pi package.  This can be accomplished in several ways.

If you have set up a ssh server to run every time you start up the raspberry pi you could just ssh into the Pi.
I usually do this so that I can manipulate the pi from my laptop/desktop.  

Windows operating systems:  
  Putty:  While it is easy to use I am partial on the gui that is given.  Currently you can download putty at: http://www.putty.org/
          After installing putty open it up and you will see the main window for putty.
          
          You don't have to modify any of putty's advanced options to ssh with the Pi.
          
          Find out the address of your Pi by either using: ifconfig in the terminal or setting the IP to a static address.
          Once you have the address put that into the Host Name line and make sure that the port is 22(common connection port for ssh)
          On the connection type pick SSH, you can save these settings by clicking save at this point by make sure you name it.
          Finally clicking open will start up a terminal-ish window that will sit there polling the IP and looking for a ssh server to connect to.
          If there is a connection you will be asked to log into the PI.
          
          If you have problems connecting to your Pi
            1. make sure that you have a ssh-server running (run sudo raspi-config and enable ssh server)
            2. check your IP address on you Pi to make sure that you have the right address.
            3. your firewall might be blocking the connection. check to make sure that it doesn't think it is a malicious task/program
            4. your network security settings might be too strict, in this case if you are at home just go change them to be less strict or if you are on a campus you will need to contact IT to move past here.
            
          
          At this point you can use the command that is given in the file: Video_streaming_pi_side
          
          raspivid -t 0 -h 1080 -w 1920d -fps 25 -vf -b 2000000 -n -o - | tee -a test_video.h264 | cvlc stream:///dev/stdin --sout '#rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8080/}' -vvv :demux=h264
          
          The explanation of what this line does is in the Video_streaming_pi_side file.
  
  Cygwin:  This gui is a little nicer to look at and it functions as a terminal on Windows systems.  Which can come in handy if you dont want to deal with Command Prompt (cmd)
