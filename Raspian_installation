So, this is a instruction manual on installing a operating system on to the raspberry pi.  This is just one of 
many ways that this process can be done.  It is just what I have found easiest to do.

Step 1:
  Aquire Raspberry pi, microSD card, and working internet connection(ethernet or wifi if you have wifi usb dongle)
    If you dont have a 5V power supply you better get one with a micro usb cord.
    (make sure that you have a adapter for the microSD card that can be used on a seperate computer.)

Step 2:
  Take both items out of box and make sure they look like they are not damaged.
  
Step 3:
  plug microSD card adapter into your computer(not the pi) to begin installing operating system for the Pi.
    a.  Go to https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/
        This is the site to download a operating system for your Raspberry Pi.
    b.  If you have never used a Linux OS before you should download NOOBS, otherwise download Raspian.
        (the other operating systems are also there but most of them don't have the firmware for the raspberry pi camera.
    c.  You should download the zip file version.  They both download at the same speed but some campuses block torrenting.
    
    d.  If you don't have a program to unpack the zip there are several different alternatives.
          Windows: I use 7zip for most of my file archiving.  There is also WinZip for windows that can do the same
            7zip   : http://www.7-zip.org/download.html
            Winzip : http://www.winzip.com/win/en/index.htm
            
            You can use either or even another program, it doesn't really matter.
            
          Mac OS (10.6 and up): I don't use mac very much but I understand that there are a decent amount of mac users
            There is a program that comes with the standart mac package called The Unarchiver (creative right?)
            There is also a program called Keka which can upzip .zip files and alot of other types of archive files
            Keka : http://www.kekaosx.com/en/
            
          Linux:  This a simple command that is executed in the command terminal
            This is the command: upzip
             unzip file.zip -d destination_folder
             If the terminal throws a error saying that the command is undefined then you might need to install a easier operating system for your computer.
    e.  now you should have something that looks like : (date_that_image_was_released)_raspbian_wheezy.img
            or something that is close to this.  You should have a file that has a .img attachment
    
Step 4:
  Flash image of operating system to your sd card
      a. make sure that your microSD card is recognized on your computer when plugged in.
          if not you need to look up the drivers for the card adapter that can be found by looking up the manufactorers website.
      b. now you need a program or command to copy the image to the sd card.
          Windows: there is a program that is called win32diskimager
              this can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/ 
              or                   http://www.softpedia.com/get/CD-DVD-Tools/Data-CD-DVD-Burning/Win32-Disk-Imager.shtml
              
              (be careful in these sites, they have many fake download buttons.)
          
          Mac OS (10.6 and up): I'm not sure how to explain this without blantenly ripping off a reliable site that has instructions
                  So here is the tutorial for Mac from the Raspberry pi website:
                                    https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md
                                    
          Linux: Since there are so many different distros for unix I am going to leave it up to elinux.org to guide this part
                http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup
                This site shows multiple different ways to install onto a sd card, including another method for windows and mac
Step 5:
  At this point you should have the image of the operating system on the sd card.
  You now should plug it into the raspberry pi board itself. 
  the sd card slot is on the bottom of the board on the opposite end of the usb ports.
  The card only fits one way and thats with the colored face of most cards facing down.
  
Step 6:
  You can now plug your Pi into a power source.
  Make sure that you only have a 5V usb source otherwise you could overvolt the power port and let some magic smoke out.
  (Depending on what you are doing you can provide more and the current should be around 1A.)
  When the pi boots up it will go through a set up sequence.  This window has raspi-config on the top of it.  
  
  If you dont go through the raspi config window when you log in you need to put into the command line 
                                                                                sudo raspi-config
                                                                                
  This will guide you a setup of your operating system
  make sure you expand sd card usage(the first option on raspi-config)
  
Step 7:
  So at this point you have your raspiberry pi all set up. the rest of my documents are for setting up a wireless
  video stream.  At this point (9/23/2015) I have all the files for 0% to 100%, If for some reason you think I don't Send me a message at skylar4494@gmail.com
